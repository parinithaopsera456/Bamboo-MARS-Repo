# Note: The concept of branches in Bamboo does not have a direct equivalent in GitHub Actions.
# You will need to handle branch creation and deletion manually or use separate scripts/actions.

# Note: Notifications and certain Bamboo-specific features like JIRA linking, 
# concurrent build plugin, and custom build expiry configurations are not directly translatable 
# to GitHub Actions and need to be managed outside of the workflow.
